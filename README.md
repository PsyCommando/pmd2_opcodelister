# pmd2_opcodelister
A quick and dirty little tool to output script opcode data and command names to a text file, and format it.

Feel free to reuse this stuff if you want. It has literally no validation or error checking, and its probably not the best way to do this, but it does the job, and its kind of a one-time thing!
